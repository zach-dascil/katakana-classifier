# Katakana Classifier

## Overview

This project explores the use of Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images of handwritten Japanese Katakana characters. Six different CNN models were used to classify the 46 main Katakana characters, exluding the characters with dakuten (◌゙) and handakuten (◌゚). The most accurate model achieved a testing accuracy of 99.15%. A video summary of the project can be found [here](google.com).

## Problem and Motivation

During my trips to Japan, I would come across words I did could not comprehend, whether it was due to the lack of my vocabulary or I was unable to read the characters. I would then spend minutes trying to find the meaning of characters to then find out the meaning of the word. This project will lay the groundwork to be able to classify words using live input.
